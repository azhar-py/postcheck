# PostCheck Plugin
PostCheck is a plugin that works with the MemberPress plugin to manage the access of your content. The plugin allows you to control the access of your WordPress posts based on the rules defined in MemberPress. It enables you to restrict the access to certain posts or pages depending on the user's membership level, subscription, or other criteria specified by MemberPress.

# Installation
1) Download the latest version of the PostCheck plugin from the github repository.
2) Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/postcheck directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

# How to use PostCheck
PostCheck is a simple and easy-to-use plugin. Once you have installed and activated the plugin, it will automatically integrate with MemberPress. 

1) Edit the post that you want to restrict access to.
2) Scroll down to the 'MemberPress' section in the post editor.
